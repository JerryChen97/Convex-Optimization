# Convex-Optimization
The repo for the homework 4 of [computational physics](https://github.com/PerimeterInstitute/Computational-Physics-Course-Winter-2020/blob/master/homework4.md)

Since the aim of this homework is not to provide any function or to implement any actual module, but to numerically fact-check some statements from the paper in Julia, here we don't set any real project environment.
