# Convex-Optimization
The repo for the homework 4 of [computational physics](https://github.com/PerimeterInstitute/Computational-Physics-Course-Winter-2020/blob/master/homework4.md)

Since the aim of this homework is not to provide any function or to implement any actual module, but to numerically fact-check some statements from the paper in Julia, here we don't set any real project environment. Even though the realization of the core of the answer to this homework comprises of much codework, it still has nothing to do with a module named convex optimization; it's just making use of this module.
Alternatively, we directly edit the jupyter notebook used in the classes and append the answer in the end following the questions.

## Introduction
We made use of the technique of convex optimization, transformed a problem of solving linear equations to a problem of optimizing nothing over the region defined by the exactly original linear equations, and then discussed on the properties indicated by the theory of linear optimization and the connections between this linear program and different causal structures.
