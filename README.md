# Convex-Optimization
The repo for the homework 4 of [computational physics](https://github.com/PerimeterInstitute/Computational-Physics-Course-Winter-2020/blob/master/homework4.md)

Since the aim of this homework is not to provide any function or to implement any actual module, but to numerically fact-check some statements from the paper in Julia, here we don't set any real project environment. Even though the realization of the core of the answer to this homework comprises of much codework, it still has nothing to do with a module named convex optimization; it's just making use of this module.
Alternatively, we directly edit the jupyter notebook used in the classes and append the answer in the end following the questions.
